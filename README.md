	PROJECT UNDER PROGRESS

- This project is a 2D Game that will be made using SDL2.0 and C++ 
- It will be a cross platform as it's very easy to do so with SDL2.0
- Mustering ideas right now on the plot of game . If any one wants to join me in this project please feel free to do so . Your ideas  are welcome.I am learning from Shaun Mitchell book on Game Development its a good text but not good if you are novice in C++. There are a lot of other good resources on the internet to learn for beginners.
- I can be contacted at anshulbahukhandi@gmail.com
- Initial ideas: 
	- create a single player game .
	- Player makes one profile that'll keep count of his total score. Whenever he plays the game score will continue building from last score.
	- Pacman type game with highly intelligent ghosts.
	- Implement Aritificial intelligence for ghosts rather than fixed path  or behaviour.
- Thanks . Feel free to suggest anymore ideas , I'll be more than glad .
